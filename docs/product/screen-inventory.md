# Application Screen Inventory

This inventory is the redesign map for the authenticated application, unauthenticated acquisition experience and tenant administration. Permission variants are verified with a tenant administrator and a restricted member.

## Shared Layouts and Permissions

- The public, authentication, tenant application and future platform-operator shells are separate layouts.
- Tenant identity is always visible in the authenticated shell. Platform controls never appear in the tenant shell.
- Navigation is generated from route availability and permissions. Planned items may be shown as disabled roadmap markers, never as working links.
- Restricted members see the same layout with unavailable records and actions removed. A hidden action is not a substitute for server authorization.
- Desktop baseline is 1440 x 900, tablet baselines are 1024 x 768 and 768 x 1024, and mobile baselines are 390 x 844 and 844 x 390.

## Redesign Sequence

M02 shell and shared components are delivered first. CRM list and record patterns follow, then activity and marketing workspaces. New automation and engagement screens are added only when their routes and backend contracts exist.
